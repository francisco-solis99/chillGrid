# ChillGrid
A chill magazine design with css grid

A magazine cover or irregular CSS design in Figma and then make it the web with just HTML and CSS using grid. I used the [AOS library](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) to add some animations as well.

Also, I added a simple GitHub action to make the deploy without a build.
